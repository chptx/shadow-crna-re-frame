`shadow-cljs` + `Create React Native App` + `Reagent` + `re-frame`

# shadow-cljs

```
# first install deps via yarn or npm
yarn

# launch shadow-cljs locally
./node_modules/.bin/shadow-cljs watch app

# global is optional but nicer to use
yarn install global shadow-cljs
shadow-cljs watch app

# wait for the first compile to finish then start the rn packager
yarn start
# or
yarn run ios
```
